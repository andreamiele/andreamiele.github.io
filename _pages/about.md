**Research interests**: Deep RL, Multi Agent RL, Foundation Models, Sequential Decision-Making

Currenlty pursuing an MSc in Computer Science @ [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/computer-science/). My ongoing research projects are centered around online reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning. I'm currently working in the [Caglar Gulcehre Lab for AI Research](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/claire/).

When I’m not doing research or working on my projects, you can find me running 🏃, hitting the gym 💪, practicing judo 🥋, biking 🚴, hiking 🏞️, or doing photography 📸.x
