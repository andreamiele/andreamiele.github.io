Hi, welcome here!
I'm currenlty pursuing an MSc in Computer Science @ [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/computer-science/). My ongoing research projects are centered around online reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning. I'm currently working in the [Caglar Gulcehre Lab for AI Research](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/claire/).

Earlier this year, I completed an internship at [Roche](https://www.roche.com/).

if you need more informations, please feel free to explore the publications and projects pages!

When I’m not doing research or working on my projects, you can find me running 🏃, hitting the gym 💪, practicing judo 🥋, biking 🚴, hiking 🏞️, or doing photography 📸.

Thank you for visiting my website! I welcome collaboration and invite you to reach out (see the icons below), whether you have ideas for impactful projects, opportunities for partnership, or simply want to connect!
