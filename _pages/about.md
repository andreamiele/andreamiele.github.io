I'm him.

When I’m not doing research or working on my projects, you can find me running 🏃, hitting the gym 💪, practicing judo 🥋, biking 🚴, hiking 🏞️, or doing photography 📸.

Thank you for visiting my website! I welcome collaboration and invite you to reach out (see the icons below), whether you have ideas for impactful projects, opportunities for partnership, or simply want to connect!
