Research Intern @ Naver Labs Europe / ex-Machine Learning Engineer Intern @Roche.

My ongoing research projects are centered around online reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning. I'm currently working in the [Caglar Gulcehre Lab for AI Research](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/claire/).

I also enjoy running 🏃, hitting the gym 💪, practicing judo 🥋, biking 🚴, hiking 🏞️, or doing photography 📸.x
